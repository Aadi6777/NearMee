            Karatupalayam is a panchayat town in the city of Erode in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
            It is the Headquarters for one of the four zones of Erode Municipal Corporation. 
            In 2011, Karatupalayam was an independent panchayat town, but has since been merged with Erode during the Corporation expansion that happened in 2011. 
            The office of Karatupalayam Zone-I and city bank, Bank of Baroda,[2] is located at Javuli Nagar along the Bhavani Road, although there are other local banks in the area.
